In my piece "Out of Orbit", Earth's typical global temperatures are visualised as the atmosphere around Earth. The year 2023, in particular summer 2023, stands out against the previous years, similar to an object that goes beyond Earth's orbit (at times already beyond the 1.5 degree warming level).

The visualisation is based on ERA5 data for 1940-2023, available from the [Copernicus press release](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-september-2023-unprecedented-temperature-anomalies) "September 2023 â€“ unprecedented temperature anomalies; 2023 on track to be the warmest year on record". The Earth is plotted in blue as the 1950-1979 baseline. All other (following) years span the "atmosphere", while 2023 is plotted with a bold dark line. The two shaded areas show a 1.5 - 2 degree warmer world, and a 2 - 3 degree warmer world, respectively.
